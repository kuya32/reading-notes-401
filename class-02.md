# Read: 02 - Arrays, Loops, Imports

## Java Imports

- Link for the site not functioning, but did my own researching for Java Imports
- To import a specific member into the current file, put an import statement at the beginning of the file before any type definitions but after the package statement, if there is one.
- To import all the types contained in a particular package, use the import statement with the asterisk (*) wildcard character.

## Different types of loops in Java

- Looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.
- Types of loops
  - For loop
    - A control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.
  - For-Each loop
    - Like a for loop, instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, you declare a variable that is the same type as the base type of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
  - While loop
    - Repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.
  - Do-While loop
    - Just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
